LilyJAZZ Font Family
===================

To make the most of these fonts, there are two text fonts that should be 
installed in the normal font installation location (which is different for 
each OS):

- **LilyJAZZText**: A hand-written font that is common for jazz text objects. This
  is the default text font in the ``LilyJAZZ.ily`` stylesheet.
- **LilyJAZZChords**: Another hand-written font that is more calm with some
  convenience characters for typesetting sharps, flats, etc. This font is
  used in the ``jazzchords.ily`` stylesheet.

Any questions relating to font installation and usage can be sent to
